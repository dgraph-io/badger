//       shows up when performing testing (e.g., specify build tag=unit).
//       We are not yet ready to do that, as it may impact customer usage as
//       well as requiring us to update the CI build flags. Moreover, the
//       current model does not actually incur any significant cost.
//       If we do this, we will also want to introduce a parallel file that
//       overrides some of these structs and functions with empty contents.

// String constants for messages to be pushed to syncChan.
