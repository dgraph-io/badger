BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent and fast key-value (KV) database written
in pure Go. It is the underlying database for [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io), a
fast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be a performant alternative to
non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.

**Use [Discuss Issues](https://discuss.dgraph.io/c/issues/badger/37) for reporting issues about this repository.**

## Project Status [March 24, 2020]

Badger is stable and is being used to serve data sets worth hundreds of
terabytes. Badger supports concurrent ACID transactions with serializable
snapshot isolation (SSI) guarantees. A Jepsen-style bank test runs nightly for
8h, with `--race` flag and ensures the maintenance of transactional guarantees.
Badger has also been tested to work with filesystem level anomalies, to ensure
persistence and consistency. Badger is being used by a number of projects which
includes Dgraph, Jaeger Tracing, UsenetExpress, and many more.

The list of projects using Badger can be found [here](#projects-using-badger).

Badger v1.0 was released in Nov 2017, and the latest version that is data-compatible
with v1.0 is v1.6.0.

Badger v2.0 was released in Nov 2019 with a new storage format which won't
be compatible with all of the v1.x. Badger v2.0 supports compression, encryption and uses a cache to speed up lookup.

The [Changelog] is kept fairly up-to-date.

For more details on our version naming schema please read [Choosing a version](#choosing-a-version).

## Getting Started

### Installing
To start using Badger, install Go 1.12 or above. Badger v2 needs go modules. Run the following command to retrieve the library.

```sh
$ go get github.com/dgraph-io/badger/v2
```
This will retrieve the library.

##### Note: Badger does not directly use CGO but it relies on https://github.com/DataDog/zstd for compression and it requires gcc/cgo. If you wish to use badger without gcc/cgo, you can run `CGO_ENABLED=0 go get github.com/dgraph-io/badger/v2` which will download badger without the support for ZSTD compression algorithm.

#### Installing Badger Command Line Tool

Download and extract the latest Badger DB release from https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/releases and then run the following commands.

```sh
$ cd badger-<version>/badger
$ go install
```
This will install the badger command line utility into your $GOBIN path.

#### Choosing a version

BadgerDB is a pretty special package from the point of view that the most important change we can
make to it is not on its API but rather on how data is stored on disk.

This is why we follow a version naming schema that differs from Semantic Versioning.

- New major versions are released when the data format on disk changes in an incompatible way.
- New minor versions are released whenever the API changes but data compatibility is maintained.
 Note that the changes on the API could be backward-incompatible - unlike Semantic Versioning.
- New patch versions are released when there's no changes to the data format nor the API.

Following these rules:

- v1.5.0 and v1.6.0 can be used on top of the same files without any concerns, as their major
 version is the same, therefore the data format on disk is compatible.
- v1.6.0 and v2.0.0 are data incompatible as their major version implies, so files created with
 v1.6.0 will need to be converted into the new format before they can be used by v2.0.0.

For a longer explanation on the reasons behind using a new versioning naming schema, you can read
[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## Design
Badger was written with these design goals in mind:

- Write a key-value database in pure Go.
- Use latest research to build the fastest KV database for data sets spanning terabytes.
- Optimize for SSDs.

Badgerâ€™s design is based on a paper titled _[WiscKey: Separating Keys from
Values in SSD-conscious Storage][wisckey]_.

<sup>1</sup> The [WISCKEY paper][wisckey] (on which Badger is based) saw big
wins with separating values from keys, significantly reducing the write
amplification compared to a typical LSM tree.

<sup>2</sup> RocksDB is an SSD optimized version of LevelDB, which was designed specifically for rotating disks.
As such RocksDB's design isn't aimed at SSDs.

<sup>3</sup> SSI: Serializable Snapshot Isolation. For more details, see the blog post [Concurrent ACID Transactions in Badger](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger-txn/)

<sup>4</sup> Badger provides direct access to value versions via its Iterator API.
Users can also specify how many versions to keep per key via Options.

### Benchmarks
We have run comprehensive benchmarks against RocksDB, Bolt and LMDB. The
benchmarking code, and the detailed logs for the benchmarks can be found in the
[badger-bench] repo. More explanation, including graphs can be found the blog posts (linked
