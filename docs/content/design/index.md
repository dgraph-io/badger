Badger was written with these design goals in mind:

- Write a key-value database in pure Go.
- Use latest research to build the fastest KV database for data sets spanning terabytes.
- Optimize for SSDs.

Badgerâ€™s design is based on a paper titled _[WiscKey: Separating Keys from
Values in SSD-conscious Storage][wisckey]_.

<sup>1</sup> The [WISCKEY paper][wisckey] (on which Badger is based) saw big
wins with separating values from keys, significantly reducing the write
amplification compared to a typical LSM tree.

<sup>2</sup> RocksDB is an SSD optimized version of LevelDB, which was designed specifically for rotating disks.
As such RocksDB's design isn't aimed at SSDs.

<sup>3</sup> SSI: Serializable Snapshot Isolation. For more details, see the blog post [Concurrent ACID Transactions in Badger](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger-txn/)

<sup>4</sup> Badger provides direct access to value versions via its Iterator API.
Users can also specify how many versions to keep per key via Options.

## Benchmarks
We have run comprehensive benchmarks against RocksDB, Bolt and LMDB. The
benchmarking code, and the detailed logs for the benchmarks can be found in the
[badger-bench] repo. More explanation, including graphs can be found the blog posts (linked
above).
