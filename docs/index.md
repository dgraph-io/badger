# Badger

## What is Badger?

BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent, and fast key-value (KV) database written in pure Go. It is
the underlying database for [Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph), a fast, distributed graph
database. It is meant to be an efficient alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB.
