## [4.0.0] - 2023-02-27

> **Warning**
> The tag v4.0.0 has been retracted due to a bug in publisher.
> Use v4.0.1 (see #1889)

This release fixes a bug in the maxHeaderSize parameter that could lead
to panics. We introduce an external magic number to keep track of external
dependencies. We bump up the minimum required Go version to 1.19. No changes
were made to the format of data on disk.  This is a major release because
we are making a switch to SemVer in order to make it easier for the community
to understand when breaking API and data format changes are made.

### Fixed
- fix: update maxHeaderSize #1877
- feat(externalMagic): Introduce external magic number (#1745) #1852
- fix(bench): bring in benchmark fixes from main #1863 

### Chores
- upgrade go to 1.19 #1868 
- enable linters (gosimple, govet, lll, unused, staticcheck, errcheck, ineffassign, gofmt) #1871 #1870 #1876 
- remove dependency on io/ioutil #1879 
- various doc and comment fixes #1857
- moving from CalVer to SemVer

### Modified APIs

#### Breaking changes:

- badger.DefaultOptions and badger.LSMOnlyOptions are now functions rather than variables (91ce687)
- badger.Item.Value now receives a function that returns an error (439fd46)
- badger.Txn.Commit doesn't receive any params now (6daccf9)
- badger.DB.Tables now receives a boolean (76b5341)

#### Not breaking changes:

- badger.LSMOptions changed values (799c33f)
- badger.DB.NewIterator now allows multiple iterators per RO txn (41d9656)
- badger.Options.TableLoadingMode's new default is options.MemoryMap (6b97bac)

### Removed APIs

## [1.5.5] - 2019-06-20

* Introduce support for Go Modules

## [1.5.3] - 2018-07-11
Bug Fixes:
* Fix a panic caused due to item.vptr not copying over vs.Value, when looking
    for a move key.

## [1.5.2] - 2018-06-19
Bug Fixes:
* Fix the way move key gets generated.
* If a transaction has unclosed, or multiple iterators running simultaneously,
    throw a panic. Every iterator must be properly closed. At any point in time,
    only one iterator per transaction can be running. This is to avoid bugs in a
    transaction data structure which is thread unsafe.

* *Warning: This change might cause panics in user code. Fix is to properly
    close your iterators, and only have one running at a time per transaction.*

## [1.5.1] - 2018-06-04
Bug Fixes:
* Fix for infinite yieldItemValue recursion. #503
* Fix recursive addition of `badgerMove` prefix. https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/commit/2e3a32f0ccac3066fb4206b28deb39c210c5266f
* Use file size based window size for sampling, instead of fixing it to 10MB. #501

Cleanup:
* Clarify comments and documentation.
* Move badger tool one directory level up.

## [1.5.0] - 2018-05-08
* Introduce `NumVersionsToKeep` option. This option is used to discard many
  versions of the same key, which saves space.
* Add a new `SetWithDiscard` method, which would indicate that all the older
  versions of the key are now invalid. Those versions would be discarded during
  compactions.
* Value log GC moves are now bound to another keyspace to ensure latest versions
  of data are always at the top in LSM tree.
* Introduce `ValueLogMaxEntries` to restrict the number of key-value pairs per
  value log file. This helps bound the time it takes to garbage collect one
  file.

## [1.4.0] - 2018-05-04
* Make mmap-ing of value log optional.
* Run GC multiple times, based on recorded discard statistics.
* Add MergeOperator.
* Force compact L0 on clsoe (#439).
* Add truncate option to warn about data loss (#452).
* Discard key versions during compaction (#464).
* Introduce new `LSMOnlyOptions`, to make Badger act like a typical LSM based DB.

Bug fix:
* (Temporary) Check max version across all tables in Get (removed in next
  release).
* Update commit and read ts while loading from backup.
* Ensure all transaction entries are part of the same value log file.
* On commit, run unlock callbacks before doing writes (#413).
* Wait for goroutines to finish before closing iterators (#421).

## [1.3.0] - 2017-12-12
* Add `DB.NextSequence()` method to generate monotonically increasing integer
  sequences.
* Add `DB.Size()` method to return the size of LSM and value log files.
* Tweaked mmap code to make Windows 32-bit builds work.
* Tweaked build tags on some files to make iOS builds work.
* Fix `DB.PurgeOlderVersions()` to not violate some constraints.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-11-30
* Expose a `Txn.SetEntry()` method to allow setting the key-value pair
  and all the metadata at the same time.

## [1.1.1] - 2017-11-28
* Fix bug where txn.Get was returing key deleted in same transaction.
* Fix race condition while decrementing reference in oracle.
* Update doneCommit in the callback for CommitAsync.
* Iterator see writes of current txn.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-11-13
* Create Badger directory if it does not exist when `badger.Open` is called.
* Added `Item.ValueCopy()` to avoid deadlocks in long-running iterations
* Fixed 64-bit alignment issues to make Badger run on Arm v7

## [1.0.1] - 2017-11-06
* Fix an uint16 overflow when resizing key slice
